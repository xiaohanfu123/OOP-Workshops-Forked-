Workshop2 covers basic dynamic memory allocation. Although I still got some problems but they also give me good lessons.

1.
The fisrt one comes from the testing function set(G, "", "ABC", 10); 
I was trying to use "if *(first) = '' || *(last) = '' "to check if the first charcter is empty charater but it resulted syntax error forcing me to check it with "if (*first='\0' || *last=='\0')", a way inherited from C. I guess that's also the reason real string type was introduced in C++.

2.
The second problem bothered me for a while. 
When I ran the testing program.
Output stopped after 
-------------------
Testing Room Functions: 
Room Number: A1010

and program crashed after print(A) were excuted. It seems my print(Room&) can handle both situations when guest.m_firstName!=nullptr && guest.m_lastName!=nullptr.

After some Goolge , I realized that when the constructor were called , all pointers without initialization will point to some random address with garbage value which my logical expression "if (guest.m_firstName!=nullptr && guest.m_lastName!=nullptr) " cannot detect. Then I modified my set(Room&) to assign all pointer to nullptr after declaring them. I've learned that it's important to initialize all pointers to nullptr immediately after declaring them.
